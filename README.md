# Module_1_Challenge

This is a five-part python program to evaluate microcredit loans. It automates the collection of data, analyzes data, performs financial calculations, filters a list of loans, and writes qualified loans to a file.

Note: Is there is a conflict in the directions? For Part 4: Conditionally Filter Lists of Loans, #2 says "...determine whether loan_price is < 500" and #3 says "...500 or less" and later, under Filter Lists of Loans (10 points) saying "append the inexpensive_loans list with loan_price that are less than 500". 

Both versions are presented here: 
loan_analyzer_less_than_500.py writes to inexpensive_loans.csv
loan_analyzer_less_than_or_equal_to_500 writes to inexpensive_loans_less_than_or_equal to_500.csv
